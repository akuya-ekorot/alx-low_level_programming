Module contains the functions necessary to find the perimiter of an island
described by the grid:

grid:
    a list of integers
    1 represents a land zone
    One cell is a square with the side length of 1
    Grid cells are connected horizontally/vertically not diagonally
    Grid is rectangular, width and height do not exceed 100
    The grid is surrounded by water, and there is one island or nothing
    The island doesn't have lakes
